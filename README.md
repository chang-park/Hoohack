# Hoohack
Hackaton
**Inspiration**
Alcohol consumption is prevalent across the globe, and sadly, many people abuse the use of alcohol, whether it be on their own or from peer pressure. Overuse of alcohol not only causes serious physical health issues, but also affects peopleâ€™s lifestyles and mental health.

**What it does**
COHOL is a program which recommends the user with the amount they should drink before being legally drunk and drunk based on their personal information and their past drinking habits. It calculates the blood alcohol contents of the user every time the user records the amount they drank and alerts the user when the BAC is above those limits.

**How we built it**
We used Java to build the 7 classes that constitutes the program. We take user inputs using scanner and use that information to provide the user with additional data.

**Challenges we ran into**
The biggest challenge we faces was figuring out how to store past dates. Storing past records was necessary to get an accurate result, and we didn't want the user to input the same information every time they were going to run the program. To solve this problem, we decided to store their information and data into a text file.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
It was our first time participating in Hackathon, so we were very proud of our efforts and the program that we created from scratch for the first time.

**What we learned**
We learned how to delete, store, and replace data in the text file and calculate the user's blood alcohol contents. We also learned how valuable it is to work together to create a program that will someday benefit others.

**What's next for COHOL**
In less than few months from now, we would love to make this into a mobile app, so people can actually use our program. Due to lack of resources, we could not write a method that physically tracks the user's location and sends it out to the trusted user, so we hope to implement those to out program.
